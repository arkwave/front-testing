1/4 (Saturday):

Outstanding: vol/price dumps. gaining access to these mandatory.


1) think about how mapping CI and symbols is gonna  [Half]
happen in options/futures objects, implement 
accordingly.
	2_ use same logic from ciprice to construct     [Done]
	ci vols from vol by delta	            

2) moneyness error.                                 [Done]
	> was a problem with self.active/self.knockedout
	 interaction in options class during 
	 self.moneyness and self.check_active calls.


2/4 (Sunday):

Conceptualize ordering in options/futures.          [Done]
	> testing

	Notes:
		
		1_ ordering in futures: taken care of during read-in, 
		based on current month and the number of contract months between target and current month.
		
		2_ ordering in options: for each given C-i price series, 
		bucket overlying options based on time to expiry (i.e. tau < x = bucket 1, x <= tau <= y = bucket 2, etc.)
		
		> implication: logic to check for which price/vol series 
		to read in should be done in simulation.py, not in any of the classes.
		
		> todo: isolate c_i from readin, which is already being done by read_data. 
		once access to vol/price dump is given, implement get_all_underlying in portfolio to specify the data that is required.
		   - done.
		> during simulation:
			1) for each product, keep track of rollover dates.                  [Done]
			2) if value_date == rollover date, update orderings                 [Done]
			(i.e. decrement ordering for options and futures, discard those        
			options that correspond to ordering 0)

			> related TODOs: 
			1) generate and store rollover dates in sim.py                      [Done]
			2) new active condition (i.e. if cond == 0, inactive, regardless).  [Done]
			3) question: barrier option expiries?                             

 
> isolate distances using get_cdist, pass that into [Done]
underlying.ordering.                                
> updating future and options object with ordering  [Done]




Simulation logic notes:

1) Timestep --> immediately handle expiries/rollovers
2) Feed in price and vol data:
	> price --> knockouts/knockins that changes activity status.
	> price --> change in value of futures and options. 
	> vol --> change in value of option
3) Handle options:
	> daily vs bullet payoff? might not actually be necessary.
4) delta/vega/gamma hedging. 
5) store changes from above 4 steps, figure out how the hell brokerage/lots/multipliers etc factor into PnL calculation.
6) store PnL against run_number --> plot a histogram, and summary statistics. 





3/4 (Monday) :

# Notes:
	> use the regular ci_vols_final dataset to actually update the portfolio. 
	vol_by_delta is purely for database purposes, can later be adapted to portfolio if so desired.
	> currently using Piecewise continuous hermite interpolation (pchip) 
	to interpolate deltas. ensures function and derivative match at those points.

	> [Done] global_vars refactoring of everything. [HIGH PRIORITY]
	> Changes to simulation logic; include placeholders for measure input.  
		- Notes:
			1) Following variables are NOT REQUIRED: [daynum, run_size, hedge_today, op_to_strike]
			2) Differences in simulation loop:
				- in PVM, init_val is reset whenever simulation block ends. in HSM, init_val is never reset, since 
				we don't have simulation blocks, nor portfolio restores. 
				- Simulation order in PVM:
					feed --> (handle exercise) --> pnl calc --> rebalance.
				- Simulation order in HSM:
					feed --> handle exercise --> pnl --> rebalance. Should probably move handle exercise into feed. 
				- decrement ordering has validity in HSM but not in PVM. 
				- PVM currently has brokerage/slippage included in PnL calculations and repr. HSM does not. 

	> [Done] Brokerage/slippage and associated PnL representation changes. 
	> [Done] changes to hedging implementation 
	> [Done] changes to feed_data implementation

5/5: 
> debug delta hedge roll
	- for some reason, offending option is not getting removed.                   [Done]
	- not finding the relevant vol in the dataframe randomly.                     [Done]
	- figure out why delta of new option isn't exactly 25 delta.                  [Done]
		- due to the strike being rounded up/down to the nearest 10.  

> refactor get_min_start_date so that it depends on portfolio rather than on the dataframe. [Done]

> refactor simulation loop so that it buys/sells according to signal provided.

	- keep loop to be in terms of voldata dates
		- change dates in signals df to account for SOD/EOD difference; signals are given a the start
		of the day <=> eod of the previous day. 

		- make changes to simulation functions to accomodate empty portfolio
			> added in .empty() method to portfolio that checks if self.OTC and self.hedge dictionaries are
			empty. Preferred checking dictionaries rather than just OTC dict to distinguish between portfolio state
			when all OTCs have expired vs an initially empty portfolio with no signal yet. 

			> changed get_min_start_date to reflect min between signals and voldata, with a bunch of extra conditions
			so that it can be applied unchanged to both prep_portfolio and prep_data with the same results.

	- [Done] need to figure out how to specify a particular month's contract even if initial portfolio is empty.
		+ for now, add in vol_id flag into the signals dataframe, default to C  N7.N7 

	- include handling logic for rollover upon crossing expiry buffer.





8/5
	
	- [DONE] sort out the inconsistency in dates between signals and voldata
		> need to somehow cross reference dates in voldata and signals such that signals_date - numdays = vdf.date
		> prelimiary steps in diagnostic. 
		+ solution was to roll all dates reported on sunday to the previous friday. introduced match_to_signals function in prep_data.py 

	- added in match_to_signals function to implement aforementioned change
	- debugged problems in prep_data when dealing with product names that had more than 1 letter --> checks to standardize the two space convention in vol_id and underlying_id. 

	- function to parse signal input:
		- date | 25d call vol | 25d put vol | signal
		- for each day:
			1) 

	- TODO: figure out why timestep isn't working
		> solution: created the option objects individually. my guess is that objects were being overwritten when added as part of one large list, but honestly not sure. 


9/5
	- solve timestep issue (done)
	- fix rounding strike per commodity (done)
	- change order of simulation loop to rebalance after signal (done)
	- ensure pnl computation only considers comparable portfolios (done)
	- logging to csv (done)

	- finish interfacing (done)



10/5
	- notes:
		1) currently apply_signal not taking any brokerage/slippage/cost of options into count since all of this happens after prev PnL computation and before next feed. 
	Further todos:
	
	> figure out how to intelligently sell the equivalent of 25 skew pos using current-day values. 
		- more specifically: vega amount specified in signal. figure out how to sell off that much vega from current position using various methods such as:
			1) first-in-last-out
			2) furthest from 25delta 

	> Notes for Ujjwal:
		- generate signal using historical data. 
		- multipliers on the buy/sell signal on the basis of skew percentile compared to history.
		- rolling bands; perhaps some sort of rolling weighted average based on historical analysis. 



11/5:

	> [Done] double check if changing lots changes greeks [high priority]
		- if not, add in new method decrement_lots that updates greeks after decrementing lots 
	> [Done] finish implementing close_off_delta 
	> [Done] testing
	> [Done] liquidation logic


12/5:
	> [Done] filo implementation: change OTC_options, hedge_options, OTC_futures and hedge_futures into deques, which have the same functionality as lists. 
	> update liqudation such that we always have vega_req * num_skews on each leg, regardless.
		- [Done] if insufficient, let it go to an empty portfolio




15/5: 
	> run test with two different products in portfolio. 
	> update coding documentation
	> flow chart for Historic/PortfolioVARModule
	> [Done] make sure generate_skew_op works with:
		- negative vega 
		- call and put flags 

	> [Done] implement liquidation logic. 
	> [Done] debug 



18/5:

High priority:
	> finalize data processing pipeline and storage of files [Done]
	> determining start date/end date given:	             [Done]
		1. user inputs                                       [Done]
		2. signals                                           [Done]
	> fully interface prep_data with database so that relevant info is pulled [Done]
	> sort out datetime issues                               [Done]


	


19/5:
	> [Done] run the soybean atm straddle  - data constraints = only 2015 and 2016 can be run. 
	> [Done] fetch_data and prep_data should accept (pdt opmth ftmth) as inputs for drawing data --> would allow for quick creation of positions 
	> [Done] data cleaning from alternate table would be useful; would allow that table to be used and integrated rather than depending on the opera one. 
		- at the very least nail down the transformation logic, give to Ujjwal  [Done]

	



20/5:
	> [Done] defining hedges in create_portfolio 
	> [Straddle - Done] 
		easy creation of certain positions (skew, straddle, etc) given relevant information. 
		- either update prep_portfolio, or make it easy to specify somehow. 	
	> [Done] hedge rolling logic
	> [Done] change sql queries to draw all data <= current contract month value. 
		- done for pdt/opmth/ftmth draws, not for others. 




	
22/5:
> take stock of all work that has been done so far - cut out redundancies and refactor as necessary. 
	- crucial :
		1. prep_portfolio vs create portfolio. (latter honestly seems superior/more flexible for composite structures (e.g. straddles, etc))

		Notes: 
			CSV --> List of dictionaries --> create portfolio
			split into OTC and hedges
				> define each option individually in its own row
				> create all OTCs, then generate hedges so that hedges can use OTC values as inputs. 
				> some kind of linkage between a hedge and the thing it is hedging? 
				> specify a greek value OR lots, depending. 


		2. util functions; where do they fit into everything?
			> left to develop: 
				- butterflies
				- spreads 




23/5:
	> new read method csv --> dict --> portfolio. Try to keep current work intact 
	> portfolio-wide hedging as a flag --> how does this work? numerical equivalent? 
	> multiple signals per day [Done]


25/5:
	- creating separate underlying for each option created. CANNOT USE SAME UNDERLYING FOR DIFFERENT OPTIONS. -> Done. 
	
	- finish up util implementations -> butterfly left to do; finalize kwarg inputs for other composites.
		> Straddles: Done. 
		> Strangles: Done. 
		> skews/fences: Done

>>>>>>> TODOS AS OF 7/12 <<<<<<<< 

1) [Done] Multiple signals per day:
	> currently relies on net_vega_pos of the entire portfolio. need to re-implement this in order to make sure different signals are applied appropriately.

> create skew apparently has some problems to be debugged. 


2) [Done] Go through skew signal application with a fine-toothed comb. PnL profiles look very similar to previous runs, consistently making money on gamma and losing on vega. Why?
	> long theta long vega long gamma, overall. gamma PnL is therefore consistently positive (since gamma is timestep + price change). 

4) [Done] run it through the debugger and make sure it is outputting correct results. 




>>>>>>>>>> TODOS as of 7/20 <<<<<<<<<<<<


1) Expand historic simulator to accept currencies. 
	> might need alternate methods in feed_data to address differences in data.
	> valuation of these options (e.g. delta gamma theta vega scaling) would not be accurate --> need to redo.
		> might need different hedging strategies/implementation? rebalance might not work explicitly. 


2) Improve on hedging code to do the following:
	> apply bound, static to each greek independently (i.e. don't assume that delta is zero and gamma/theta/vega are bounded)
	
	> accept multiples of current TTM
		- need some kinda way to check wha
	
	> accept fixed ttm for hedging that decrements with each passing day. 

	> [Done] ensure that rollovers work for  multiple products. 
	> [Done] edit grab data to search for and accept data if it is already saved rather than querying database. 
	> [Done] updated all dictionaries to change LCC to QC as per database.
	> [Done] implemented flexible rollovers for multiple vol_ids 
	> [Done] updated scripts/util.create_vanilla and create_straddle to accept atm as a strike value. 
	> [Done] debugged construction errors with create_vanilla and create_underlying.

-------------------
|As of 08/28/2017 |
-------------------
> Expand HSM to allow for Intraday data. 
	- flag as to whether or not data is intraday or settlement to settlement. ==> infer from dataset? pass in as input?
	- how will this change data grabbing functions?
	- new functions to prepare intraday data for simulation -> need samples. 

	- idea: additional flag where timestep step is determined by a flag in the data. 
	- conditional intraday delta Hedging
		= value-based
		= breakeven-based 
	 	--> need to write new functions/reconceptualize delta hedging;
	 		- rethink hedge object
	 		- inputs. 

	- timestep reconciliation; assume N intraday price moves and K intraday vol moves where N > K. Need
	  to do the following:
	  	1) bundle together vol and price data on the basis of timestamp. 
	  	2) apply these together. 
	  	> for each date in dates:
	  		for timestamp in pdf[pdf.date == date]:
	  			do the things. 

	- something that will look for the EOD flag; one timestamp will be designated the EOD timestamp 
		--> this is when rebalance(), signal() and pf.Timestep() will be called





-------------------------- OPEN ISSUES: ------------------------

> Vol reconciliation 
    - when initializing an option with delta rather than with strike, the vols are slightly different
    even when the strikes turn out to be identical. --> leads to different delta values. 
    - caused due to the vol_by_delta interpolation steps.
    - explicit example run: (50, 50) strangle vs an atm straddle. 
    - difference is very small; on the example monitored it's 0.0006 = 0.06%


> Backend Implementation
	- proper conceptualizing of slippage, aside from flat-value. bring all in line to this. 
	- Signals and Families
		1. adjusting signals to include family paradigm 
		2. related: implement a future signals thing.


> Plotly visualization:
	- same contract vol surface on two different days. 
	- more descriptive statistics:
		- [Done] drawdown
		- labeling when the rolls happened (i.e. different color when log.delta_rolled) 


> GUI Dev:
	- [Done] need to fix/debug assign_ci / ciprice / civols. pretty badly. 
	- integrate with Portfolio VAR Module. 
	- get ordering back into place in HistoricSimulator as a variable.
	- composites in simulator that are NOT part of the same family. --> flag to mark these two options as composites. 
	- Figure out new windows for each family. 


------------------------------------------------------------





********** Notes on certain issues: ***********

> Open issue: move from centralized hedging specifications to more general forumlation via families, possibly. 
	- TENTATIVE SOLUTION:
		> each family is a portfolio object.
		> hedges now come in two types: family-specific and portfolio-wide. 
		> family-specific hedges (and by extension hedge object) will be associated with the relevant family. 

	- things that need to change:
		1) hedging for gamma/theta/vega/delta-rolls would be family-specific. 
		2) static delta hedging would be portfolio-wide. 
		3) rolling over contract to next month can either be family specific (if ttm_tol only specified) or portfolio-wide (if roll_product is also specified.)
		4) hedges [dict] would need to be altogether removed from simulation. 
		5) hedge [object] would now be associated with a portfolio. 
		6) creating a portfolio would now take in options/futures as well as a hedge.
