####### General Concepts: ##########

1) Differences in exercising:
	- American: can be exercised at any time before expiry.
	- European: exercised only at expiry.

2) Different kinds of options:

	- Vanilla Options
		> Call
			: Right but not the obligation to BUY AT STRIKE PRICE.
			: Option Buyer expects price to rise.
			: Option seller expects price to fall.
		> Put
			: Right but not the obligation to SELL AT STRIKE PRICE.
			: Option Buyer expects the price to fall.
			: Option Seller expects the price to rise.

	- Barrier options: In general cheaper than vanilla?

		> Down & In
			: Barrier price is below current market price. 
			: Option becomes active iff market hits barrier at any time before expiry (American) or on expiry (European)
			: Properties
				- Calls: right to buy iff market < barrier. anticipating a u-shaped movement.
				- Puts : right to sell at strike iff market < barrer. hedging against large moves. 

		> Down & Out
			: Barrier price is BELOW market price.
			: Option is void if market hits barrier at any time before expiry (American) or on expiry (European)
			: Properties
				- Calls: right to buy iff market > barrier. limits loss for option buyer.
				- Puts : right to sell iff market > barrier. limits loss for option seller. cheaper than regular put.

		> Up & In
			: Barrier price is ABOVE market price.
			: Option is valid iff market hits barrier at any time before expiry (American) or on expiry (European)
			: Properties
				- Calls: right to buy iff market hits barrier. captures big moves, bigger payoff/price ratio relative to vanilla. Cheaper than vanilla.
				- Puts : right to sell iff market hits barrier. anticipating a u-shaped trend (downwards)?

		> Up & Out
			: Barrier price is ABOVE market price.
			: Option is void if market hits barrier at any time before expiry (American) or on expiry (European)
			: Properties
				- Calls: right to buy iff market < barrier. limits the downside to option writer, limits upside for option holder. worth less than vanilla call.
				- Puts : right to sell iff market < barrier. relatively confident prices will stay within barrier (duh), squeezing maximum possible profit from nonmoving underlying?
