Questions for Ananthi:



1) Explain project to him
	
	- module that simulates the performance of an options portfolio, and evolves portfolio by:
		1. delta hedging
		2. gamma/theta hedging.
	
	- what kind of data is available?
		0.  trades that were made
		0.5 portfolios that were traded
		1.  underlying price data series
		2.  vol series
		3.  what kind of underlying
		4.  time scale of data
		5.  price series for options on various underlyings?

		> current formulation requires high, low, close, vol for each underlying.

	- potential access to the database?








General questions - Data related.



1. are all the options in the portfolio basis the same underlying? 
[Probably not]

2. if not, is there a certain range of underlying futures?
	> would require high, low, close for each underlying in the entire portfolio across the testing period.
	> would additionally require that each option have an 'underlying' marker so that value is computed appropriately.
	> standardize data upon reading in; select data that is relevant to each option.

3. are we assuming that options are never exercised, only expire?
	> if not, this turns into effectively an options simulator.
	> need to code in buying/selling rules for options/futures, and when the counterparty would choose to exercise.
		- relationship between buying and hedging?
		- what happens at the end of the month/three months upon expiry?





Computation-specific questions:

1. Selecting tau value when buying/selling options to go into the portfolio.
	> what options are usually available in the market?
	> any heuristic for selling options when greeks exceed bounds?

2. Stochasticity in PnL: coming from the MC engine?
